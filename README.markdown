# Soccer League Manager

This is a Rails application designed to manage soccer leagues, specifically teams, players and their stats. 

### Features
You can add, update, and filter for these entities:
* Organizations (such as Federations or Associations)
* Leagues (anything from English Premier League to your local pub league)
* Teams
* Players

Additionally, you can manage the stats for an individual game. You can create a game roster and enter individual players stats in a game. This area still needs some work. Your mileage may vary.

This project is being continually improved. There is no official release yet. If you want to use it, feel free to fork it. Contributions are welcome. I have ideas for other features like cataloging venues and stadiums, managing coaches and staff, and adding more roles to handle sharing/collaboration.

### Getting Started
This is a Rails application. If you are new to Ruby or Rails, start [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org). Currently, I run this on Ruby 1.9.2 with PostgreSQL as the database. See Gemfile for other dependency information.

### License
see LICENSE

### Why did you create this app?
I wanted to learn more Ruby and Rails. And, I love soccer. That's all the reason I need.

### But I don't want game management
OK. If you would like something simpler without game management, you can pull down the `stats_by_seasons` branch. That branch is old and not maintained. But the basic relationships are there and might be suitable for your needs.
