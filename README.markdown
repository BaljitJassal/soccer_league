# Soccer_League Manager

This is an application to manage soccer leagues, specifically teams, players and their stats.

This project is under heavy development right now. It should be usable soon-ish. 

## Branches


My first attempt at this application had me designing this to track stats by an entire season (not by match). For me, this made the code much easier to write and the app easy to use. But, you don't really get to track things at a fine level of detail. If you want an app like that, then pull down the `stats_by_season`. That branch is still a mostly incomplete app. But, it's something to work with.

With that said, the `master` branch is still under heavy development. But, it now sports the ability to track stats by match and to maintain a roster of players.
